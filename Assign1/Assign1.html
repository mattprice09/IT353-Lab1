              <hr>
              <p>If there was one thing I wanted to share, it would be about my upcoming summer internship at GoDaddy.
                My supervisor told me my role will be considered full-stack, meaning lots of web development. I've done a few
                hackathons and made some web applications, however I am still a novice with web dev. My goal is to learn an abundance of knowledge/skills this semester in an attempt to prepare myself as much as possible for my upcoming internship. </p>

              <h2 align="center">Q&A</h2>
              <hr>
              <h5><strong><em>Do you have Java experience?</em></strong></h5>
              <p class="answers-p">Yes. I've taken IT169 and IT179 at ISU, and I also took an Android development 
                class at Parkland College. Furthermore, I've coded in Java for large projects at work and also for
                 my own side projects.</p>
              <h5><strong><em>Do you have Database experience?</em></strong></h5>
              <p class="answers-p">Yes. I just finished IT261 at ISU, and I also took a database theory course at Parkland
                College. I also have experience with databases from work. We are operating big data with a MongoDB and are
                currently in the preliminary phases of designing a relational database.</p>
              <h5><strong><em>Do you any Web development experience?</em></strong></h5>
              <p class="answers-p">Yes. There are three projects that I've been a part of:</p><br>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Home Fly</strong> - Web app for homeless individuals to find the nearest homeless shelter and 
                  get information including address, phone number, and number of available beds. User inputs their address
                  and gets all shelters within 10 miles. We used the Meteor framework and won HuskieHack with it.</li>
                <li><strong>UniSound</strong> - Another hackathon project. It is a social jukebox web app in which users
                  can either host or join a party. It utilizes Spotify's API so that users can search for songs and queue
                  them up into the party's playlist in real time. We used FireBase for our back-end.</li>
                <li><strong>HTI Dashboard</strong> - A dashboard for our database at work. We use Flask + pymongo for our
                  backend. For our frontend, I think I'm going to implement Bootstrap as soon as I get a hang of it!!</li>

                  <div class="panel-body">
                    Mashups: The new breed of Web app is all about the new age of web applications - mashups. Essentially,
                    a mashup is a web app that utilizes different data sources or APIs. As an example, I'll use my Home Fly
                    project listed above. We utilized both the Google Places API and web-scraped data about shelter listings.
                    These were conglomerated into a web app that matched the addresses from the web-scraped data to the actual
                    location that Google provided.<br><br>
                    One of the things in the article that stuck with me the most was about Ajax. First off, the article states
                    that Ajax requires JavaScript to be enabled. Because of this, robots, spiders, and web crawlers are unable
                    to navigate through your page if you use Ajax frequently. This is a huge piece of information as this is
                    capable of destroying a web page's search engine visibility. Not only that, but the article explains that,
                    if user-updated content is tied only to an Ajax call, it will not be reinstated when the BACK button is pressed.
                    Perhaps this is what happens when you fill out a form, click Next, then go back, only to find that you have
                    to redo the entire form.

                <div class="panel panel-default assignment-answer" id="duolingo-answer">
                  <div class="panel-body">
                    The man who wants to translate the Web is an article about a guy's startup company. The company is called
                    Duolingo and its purpose is to make the Web intelligible through any spoken language. That is, the company's
                    goal is to essentially be able to translate any web page. Obviously, this would be a great accomplishment.
                    There are just a couple of drawbacks.<br><br>
                    First off, finding enough people to accurately translate between two languages is difficult. To add to that,
                    PAYING these people who can translate for the company would be nearly impossible. This is how Duolingo evolved
                    into its current business model: for the price of your education results, you can learn a language for free
                    on their platform. The company simply uses your data as food for their machine learning algorithms and, 
                    ultimately, their database.

            SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is extremely important for businesses because it is the core of web visibility. SEO is essentially the degree to which you make your website visible and relevant to search engines. If you do well with your SEO through the use of solid keywords, credible site-to-site links, busy traffic, and easy crawlability for spiders, then you will have a good shot at getting to the first page on search results.

            The first, more basic article is an article meant to introduce newbies on the basics of how the web works. The second article is a more detailed article whose purpose is to explain exactly <em>how</em> the web works.
            One of the things I noticed right away is the presence of GET and POST explanations in the second article. This information is vital to developing web applications as it is the core of how web communication works. I also noticed that they mentioned browser redirects from http://facebook.com to http://www.facebook.com. The article states that this helps with SEO.
